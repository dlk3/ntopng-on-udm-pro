# Building ntopng for Fedora

This repository contains the source material I use to build ntopng for Fedora  

I run the <code>build-ntopng-fedora</code> script that's in this project weekly on my local workstation to automate the build of a new RPM with a new unstable release of ntopng from [GitHub](https://github.com/ntop/ntopng).  This is then uploaded to my COPR repository: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dlk/rpms/
