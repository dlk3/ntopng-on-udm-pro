# Running ntopng Natively On The Unbiquiti Dream Machine Pro (UDM-Pro)

With the release of Unifii OS v2.4.27 on UDM Pro devices, ntopng can now be run natively on the UDM.  A podman container is no longer required.

Ntop builds stable and unstable builds that will run on the UDM.  See their [installation instructions](https://packages.ntop.org/) for the Raspian/rPi OS build.  The "buster_pi (arm32)" version there is what will install in the Debian (Buster) 11.7 OS on the UDM.  (As of 2024-01-16)
